// Requirements: "1. Write a function that has an implementation of selection sort which is stable.
// (Hint: May be we need to trade off with the benefit of selection sort of less swaps)

// 2. Given an array of strings arr[], sort it in ascending order based upon the frequency of strings. If frequency is same then sort based upon the lexicographical order.
// Input: arr[] = {“abc”, “pqr”, “pqr”, “abc”}
// Output: {“abc”, “pqr”}
